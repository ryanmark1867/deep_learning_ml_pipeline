# ML pipeline for a Trained Deep Learning Model

This repo contains the code for a simple Kubeflow ML pipeline for a trained deep learning model for the upcoming Manning book on machine learning with tabular data. This is part of the code for the end-to-end deep learning and MLOps chapter. This code is designed to be run from Cloud SHell in Google Cloud.
